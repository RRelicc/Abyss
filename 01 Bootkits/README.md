# ***🚀🦑 Bootkits Development Starter Pack***

This folder previously contained learning material, notes, and introductory examples related to UEFI bootkit development. To keep Abyss clean, all beginner-friendly content has been moved to a dedicated repository:

📌 **[TheMalwareGuardian: Bootkits Development Starter Pack](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Bootkits-Development-Starter-Pack)**

If you're just getting started with pre-boot development, UEFI applications, or want to manually set up your environment and compile your first bootkit sample, the Starter Pack is the right place to begin.

This folder remains here only as a placeholder for internal references within the Abyss project.
